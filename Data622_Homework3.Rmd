# Overview
In this project, the dataset used, is for Loan approval where the prediction will be done for Loan approval status using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees and Random Forest models.

# R packages
We will use `r` for data modeling. All packages used for data exploration, visualization, preparation and modeling are listed in Code Appendix.

```{r libraries, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Libraries

library(summarytools)
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(622)
```

# Data Exploration
Below is the description of the variables of interest in the data set.
